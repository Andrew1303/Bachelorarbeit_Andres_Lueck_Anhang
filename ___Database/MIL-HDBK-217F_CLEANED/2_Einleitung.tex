\chapter{Introdruction}
The handbook is a summary of basefailurerates extracted from the \cite{MIL-HDBK-217F} created by the department of defense in 
washington. The \cite{MIL-HDBK-217F} last creationdate was 02. december 1991. The quality of the document is very bad, which 
makes any systematically analysis of the document very difficult. With the reworked version containing only tables for base failure
rates written with LaTeX it should help for any automated processes to extract information from the document.
